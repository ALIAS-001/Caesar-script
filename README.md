# Homemade encryption
## how it works
this script takes the position of a given character and based on the position the character is in the string, it will either shift up or down
ex. f -> i or f -> c based on where the f is

## inputs

1 is for encryption 0 is for decryption<br>
string to encrypt/decrypt<br>
1 for an additional shift 0 for none<br>
^^ this is just an addition<br>
output
